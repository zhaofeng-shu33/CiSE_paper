\begin{abstract}
Scientific Experiment Reproducibility is vital for the advancement of disciplines based on previous work. Many researchers focus on complex methodology and self-invented tools which have difficulty in practical usage. In this article, we borrow the DevOps infrastructure from software engineering community and shows how DevOps can be used effectively in reproducible experiments for computer science related disciplines. DevOps can be enabled using freely accessible computing machines for medium sized experiment and lab HPC environment for large scale computing, thus powering researchers to share their experiment with others in a more reliable way.
\end{abstract}

\maketitle

As the development of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, computational scientific experiments encompass more disciplines but are much more complex than before. Training a useful AI model not only takes a long time but consumes huge memory and requires advanced computational device like GPU.

\section{COPYRIGHT AND CLEARANCE}

All CS Magazine authors must obtain clearance from IEEE Computer Society before submitting the final manuscript. The ``\href{https://apps.na.collabserv.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W18e544042a85_4b63_915a_1d1ed2cf8338/page/Publication\%20clearance}{Publication Clearance}'' wiki provides details about the procedure. Computer Society employees must use the \href{https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/cs-ieee}{ScholarOne  Manuscripts Clearance} System to obtain publication approval.

\section{SECTIONS}

Sections following the introduction should present your results and findings. The body of the paper should be approximately 6,000 words. The manuscript should evolve so that each sentence, equation, figure, and table flow smoothly and logically from whatever precedes it. Relevant work by others, as well as relevant products from other companies, should be adequately and accurately cited. Sufficient support should be provided (or cited) for the assertions made and conclusions drawn.

Headings may be numbered or unnumbered (``1 Introduction'' and ``1.2 Numbered level 2 head''), with no ending punctuation. As demonstrated in this document, the initial paragraph after a headingis not indented.

\section{JOURNAL STYLE}

Use American English when writing your paper. The serial comma should be used (``a, b, and c'' not ``a, b and c''). In American English, periods and commas are within quotation marks, like ``this period.'' Other punctuation is ``outside''! The use of technical jargon, slang, and vague or informal English should be avoided. Generic technical terms should instead be used.

\subsection{Acronyms and abbreviations}

All acronyms should be defined at first mention in the abstract and in the main text. Define in figures, tables, and footnotes only if not defined in the discussion of the figure/table. Acronyms consist of capital letters (except where salted with lowercase), but the terms they represent need not be given initial caps unless a proper name is involved (``central processing unit'' [CPU] but ``Fourier transform'' [FT]). Use of ``e.g.'' and ``i.e.'' okay, but refrain from using ``etc.'' It is preferable to use these abbreviations only in parentheses (e.g., like this).

Abbreviate units of time (s, min, hr, day, mo, yr) only in virgule constructions (10~$\umu$g/hr) and in artwork; otherwise, spell out, e.g., 10 days, 3 months, 25 minutes. Units of measure (Kb, MB, kWh, etc.) should always be abbreviated when used with a numeral. If used alone, spell out (``16 MB of RAM'' but ``these values are measured in micrometers'').

\subsection{Numbers}

Spell out numerals that have no unit of measure or time (one, two, $\ldots$ ten), but always use numerals with units of time and measure. Some examples are as follows: 11 through 999; 1,000; 10,000; twentieth century; twofold, tenfold, 20-fold; 2 times; 0.2 cm; $p = .001$; 25\%; 10\% to 25\%.

\section{MATH AND EQUATIONS}

Scalar {\it variables} and {\it physical constants} should be italicized, and a bold (non-italics) font should be used for {\bf vectors} and {\bf matrices}. Do not italicize subscripts unless they are variables.

Equations should be either display (with a number in parentheses) or inline.   


Display equations should be flush left and numbered consecutively, with equation numbers in parentheses and flush right.

Be sure the symbols in your equation have been defined before the equation appears or immediately following. Please refer to ``Equation (1),'' not ``Eq. (1)'' or ``equation (1).''

Punctuate display equations when they are part of the sentence preceding it, as in
\begin{equation}
A=\pi r^2.
\end{equation}
In addition, if the text following the equation flows logically as a part of the display equation, 
\begin{equation}
A=\pi r^2,
\end{equation}
use ending punctuation (comma) after the display equation.

\section{LISTS}

Avoid using lists. Instead, use full sentences and flowing paragraphs. If you absolutely must use a list, use them rarely and keep them short:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Style for bulleted lists}---This is the style that should be used for bulleted lists.
	
\item {\it Punctuation in lists}---Each item in the list should end with a period, regardless of whether full sentences are used.
\end{itemize}

\section{GRAPHICAL ABSTRACTS}

This journal accepts graphical abstracts, and they must be peer reviewed, which means the graphical abstract must be submitted with the full paper. graphical abstracts and their specifications.

\section{FIGURES AND TABLES}

\subsection{In-text callouts for figures and tables}

Figures and tables must be cited in the running text in consecutive order. At first mention, the citation should be boldface ({\bf Figure 1}); subsequent mentions should be Roman type (see Figure 1 and {\bf Table 1}). {\bf Figure 2} shows an example of a figure spanning across two columns.
 

Previously published figures or tables require permission to reprint. Please obtain permission. Then, add the following text to the figure/table caption: ``From [reference no.], with permission,'' or ``Adapted from [reference no.], with permission.'' {\it Carefully} explain each figure in the text. Each manuscript should be limited to four figures.\pagebreak

\section{END SECTIONS}

\subsection{Appendices}

If multiple appendices are required, they should labeled ``Appendix A,'' ``Appendix B,'' etc. They appear before the ``Acknowledgment'' or the ``References'' section.

\subsection{Acknowledgment}

The ``Acknowledgment'' (no's) section appears immediately after the conclusion. If applicable, this is where you indicate funding for the work. The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in American English is without an ``e'' after the ``g.'' Avoid expressions such as ``One of us (S.B.A.) would like to thank $\ldots$ .'' Instead, write ``We thank $\ldots$.'' Sponsor and financial support acknowledgments are included in the acknowledgment section. For example: This work was supported in part by the U.S. Department of Commerce under Grant BS123456 (sponsor and financial support acknowledgment goes here). Researchers that contributed information or assistance to the article should also be acknowledged in this section. Also, if corresponding authorship is noted in your paper it will be placed in the acknowledgment section. Note that the acknowledgment section is placed at the end of the paper before the reference section.

\subsection{References}


References need not be cited in text. When they are, they appear on the 
line, in square brackets, inside the punctuation. Multiple references are 
each numbered with separate brackets. When citing a section in a book, 
please give the relevant page numbers. In text, refer simply to the 
reference number. Do not use ``Ref.'' or ``reference'' except at the 
beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{CC1} shows $\ldots$ .'' Please do not use 
automatic endnotes in \emph{Word}, rather, type the reference list at the end of the 
paper using the ``References'' style.

Reference numbers are set flush left and form a column of their own, hanging 
out beyond the body of the reference. The reference numbers are on the line, 
end with period. In all references, the given name of the author 
or editor is abbreviated to the initial only and precedes the last name. Use 
them all; use \emph{et al.} only if names are not given. Use commas around Jr., 
Sr., and III in names. Abbreviate conference titles. When citing IEEE 
transactions, provide the issue number, page range, volume number, year, 
and/or month if available. When referencing a patent, provide the day and 
the month of issue, or application. References may not include all 
information; please obtain and include relevant information. Do not combine 
references. There must be only one reference with each number. If there is a 
URL included with the print reference, it can be included at the end of the 
reference. 

Other than books, capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except 
for proper nouns and element symbols. For papers published in translation 
journals, please give the English citation first, followed by the original 
foreign-language citation See the end of this document for formats and 
examples of common\break references. For a complete discussion of references and 
their formats, see the IEEE style manual at
\url{http://www.ieee.org/authortools}.
